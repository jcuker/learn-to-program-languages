# What
This repo serves as a resource as I attempt to learn how programming languages work internally. See the subfolders for each resource for more information on the particular resource. 

# How
My plan is to start with the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

# Why
In order to fully understand how programming works, I need to know what happens once I am done writing my code and hand it off to the compiler, interpreter, transpiler, etc.
