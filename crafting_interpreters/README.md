# Crafting Interpreters
This repo serves as a place to store the code, challenges, and any other resources used whilst following the [book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). 

## Branching Strategy
Each branch will implement its respective chapter fully. This means the code will be as it were at the end of the chapter, the chapter's challenges will be completed, and any additional resources needed will be included.
